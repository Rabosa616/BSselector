objective

```
    Help YOU & your TEAM
    CHOOSE for your project a proper:
```

HEY WAIT! what's this flow BS stuff?

- is this a *self-help therapy*?
- do I really need BS?
- can't I do without? (as usual)
- *how much* does this cost?
- what do I get/avoid *in return*?

  Pandoc uses fenced div for multiple columns in slide shows.

  a slide show with a very simple, uncluttered look.
  If you are using a lot of columns, you might consider
  a different slide format.

# purpose & value

---

about workflows and strategies

* conventions between developers
* how to store, branch, merge changes
* how to publish and deploy ...
* a B.S. is part of a (git) workflow
* the most important one


---

now seriously, do I need one?

* you may not (who knows)
* will **most probably** be helpful
* ... and will save time & money
* **be careful**! choosing *the wrong one*
* ... will be painful
